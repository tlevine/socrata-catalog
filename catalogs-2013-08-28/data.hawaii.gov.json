  "description" : "FARS is a steady state crash data collection and analysis program. It was implemented to improve the availability of data needed for improving vehicle safety performance and reducing deaths related to vehicles in transport. The Agency's goal is to reduce fatal injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes to a rate of 1.0 fatalities per 100M VMT from the current rate of 1.5. It is the only national census data system for fatal vehicle crashes. FARS is extensively referenced to support legislation, enforcement and education programs designed to reduce injury and property damage resulting from motor vehicle crashes. The FARS data are used by virtually all traffic safety professionals and other customers interested in traffic safety including: Congress, NHTSA, USDOT, State agencies, the automotive industry, the insurance industry, advocacy groups, international users, and the general public. The FARS data support customers' most significant programs that address traffic safety. It is the basis for the Agency's traffic safety grants to the States for programs such as the Impaired Driver Program. FARS collects State level data for analysis of traffic safety crashes to identify problems and evaluate countermeasures designed to reduce injuries and property damage resulting from motor vehicle crashes. The data are used for agency rulemaking and targeting grant money to areas most in need. The types of data collected can be used specifically to conduct research on ways to remediate problems such as alcohol involvement, vehicle types, weather and road conditions, seat belt use, car seats, air bags. The program provides analytical data and information to the public through various media, including the program's web services. The program is able to target data collections to respond to the most recent Congressional interest and mandates for new data. The Information Technology component provides for support for operations and maintenance of the program's data collection application, client server platform, and communications network that is consistent with the Agency's architecture and standards. Without the FARS program and data, many of the legislative actions, enforcement, and education programs designed to save lives and reduce traffic safety related injuries and property damage could not be targeted, affected, or enacted.",

Product manufacturers who become DfE partners, and earn the right to display the DfE logo on recognized products, have invested heavily in research, development and reformulation to ensure that their ingredients and finished product line up on the green end of the health and environmental spectrum while maintaining or improving product performance.  EPA's Design for the Environment Program (DfE) has allowed use of their logo on over 2500 products.

Prior to January 21, 2010, this data was not available. The data include fails-to-deliver in equity securities. The values of total fails-to-deliver shares represent the aggregate net balance of shares that failed to be delivered as of a particular settlement date. Fails to deliver on a given day are a cumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day. The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails. In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's aggregate fails. Thus, it is important to note that the age of fails cannot be determined by looking at these numbers. In addition, the underlying source(s) of the fails-to-deliver shares is not necessarily the same as the underlying source(s) of the fails-to-deliver shares reported the day prior or the day after.",

  "description" : "The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the VA's Under Secretary for Health are committed to transparency - giving Americans the facts. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) releases the quality goals and measured performance of VA health care in order to ensure public accountability and to spur constant improvements in health care delivery. The success of this approach is reflected in our receipt of the Annual Leadership Award from the American College of Medical Quality.  Much of the data in LinKS and ASPIRE are simply not measured in other health systems - VA is raising the bar. When available, VA uses outside benchmarks but often sets VA standards or goals at a higher level. VA scores hospitals more than 30% different from the goal as underperforming or red and those only 10% different from the goal are shown in green in ASPIRE. But a red site within the VA might be a good performer compared to outside counterparts. The scoring system is designed to move VA forward. ASPIRE is not about finding fault but about helping VA to target opportunities for improving performance   ASPIRE is a dashboard that documents quality and safety goals for all VA Hospitals. This data shows strengths and opportunities for improvement at the national, regional and local hospital level. Aspire data supports the VA's mission of a continuous health care improvement program to provide the best possible care to Veterans. The database lists many \"measures\" and our goal for each measure. The data shows \"where we are\" in comparison to where we want to be. A simple example would be for blood pressure management. The goal for all veterans age 18-85 with high blood pressure is to have blood pressure readings less than 140/90. This measure shows the percentage of Veterans meeting that blood pressure goal. The data in this dashboard will be updated on a regular basis.   VA's Linking Information Knowledge and Systems (LinKS) is a dashboard that documents outcome measures for acute care, ICU, outpatient, safety and annual measures. This data shows strengths and opportunities for improvement at the national, regional and local hospital levels. LinKS supports the VA mission to provide the best possible care to the Veterans. The dashboard shows what we are measuring and our result. A simple example would be for smoking. We measure the percentage of veterans that smoke and what we've done to help them stop smoking such as smoking cessation classes, counseling or medication to help them quit. The data will be updated on a regular basis.",

The archived data includes base data and derived products of the National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Surveillance Radar 88 Doppler (WSR-88D) next generation (NEXRAD) weather radar.  Weather radar detects the three meteorological base data quantities: reflectivity, mean radial velocity, and spectrum width.  From these quantities, computer processing generates numerous meteorological analysis products for forecasts, archiving and dissemination.  There are 159 operational  NEXRAD radar systems deployed throughout the United States and at selected overseas locations.  At the Radar Operations Center (ROC) in Norman OK, personnel from the NWS, Air Force, Navy, and FAA use this distributed weather radar system to collect the data needed to warn of impending severe weather and possible flash floods; support air traffic safety and assist in the management of air traffic flow control; facilitate resource protection at military bases; and optimize the management of water, agriculture, forest, and snow removal.  This data set is jointly owned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Federal Aviation Administration, and Department of Defense.",

For 2001, instead of a survey of chief prosecutors, a census of all 2,341 chief prosecutors who handled felony cases in state courts of general jurisdiction was conducted. A chief prosecutor is an official, usually locally elected and typically with the title of district attorney or county attorney, who is in charge of a prosecutorial district made up of one or more counties, and who conducts or supervises the prosecution of felony cases in a state court system. Prosecutors in courts of limited jurisdiction, such as municipal prosecutors, were not included in the survey. The census' purpose was to obtain detailed descriptive information on prosecutors' offices, as well as information on their policies and practices. Variables cover staffing, funding, special categories of felony prosecutions, caseload, juvenile matters, work-related threats or assaults, the use of DNA evidence, and community-related activities, such as involvement in neighborhood associations.   The unit of analysis is the district office.",

Calculator users can now review and change the assumptions behind the ERS cost estimates for either STEC O157 or Salmonella. The assumptions that can be modified include the annual number of cases, the distribution of cases by severity, the use or costs of medical care, the amount or value of time lost from work, the costs of premature death, and the disutility costs for nonfatal cases. Users can also update the cost estimate for inflation for any year from 1997 to 2007.",

Data were collected from children, their families, their teachers, and their schools at multiple points in time (i.e., fall and spring kindergarten, fall and spring first grade, spring third grade, spring fifth grade, spring eighth grade).  The ECLS-K program provides national data on children's transition to school and their  experiences and growth through the eighth grade. The ECLS program also provides data to analyze the relationships among a wide range of family, school, community, and child characteristics with children's development, learning, and performance in school. n",

  "description" : "Background: Chemical toxicity testing is being transformed by advances in biology and computer modeling, concerns over animal use and the thousands of environmental chemicals lacking toxicity data. EPA's ToxCast program aims to address these concerns by screening and prioritizing chemicals for potential human toxicity using in vitro assays and in silico approaches.  Objectives: This project aims to evaluate the use of in vitro assays for understanding the types of molecular and pathway perturbations caused by environmental chemicals and to build initial prioritization models of in vivo toxicity.   Methods: We tested 309 mostly pesticide active chemicals in 467 assays across 9 technologies, including high-throughput cell-free assays and cell-based assays in multiple human primary cells and cell lines, plus rat primary hepatocytes. Both individual and composite scores for effects on genes and pathways were analyzed.   Results: Chemicals display a broad spectrum of activity at the molecular and pathway levels. Many expected interactions are seen, including endocrine and xenobiotic metabolism enzyme activity. Chemicals range in promiscuity across pathways, from no activity to affecting dozens of pathways. We find a statistically significant inverse association between the number of pathways perturbed by a chemical at low in vitro concentrations and the lowest in vivo dose at which a chemical causes toxicity. We also find associations between a small set in vitro assays and rodent liver lesion formation.  Conclusions: This approach promises to provide meaningful data on the thousands of untested environmental chemicals, and to guide targeted testing of environmental contaminants.",

  "description" : "As part of its mandate under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission requires periodic reports from public and private employers, and unions and labor organizations which indicate the composition of their work forces by sex and by race/ethnic category. Key among these reports is the EEO-1, which is collected annually from Private employers with 100 or more employees or federal contractors with 50 more employees. In 2007, over 67,800 employers with more than 61.3 million employees filed EEO-1 reports. The confidentiality provision which governs release of these data (Section 709 (e) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972) prohibits release of individually identifiable information. However, data in aggregated format for major geographic areas and by industry group for private employers (EEO-1) are available. The following tables are national aggregations by those industries with the greatest employment.",

Map-a-Planet is driven by the MapMaker engine, software developed by the USGS Astrogeology Research Program to generate image maps from our image data repository. The data sets served by the site are cartographically accurate global image mosaics prepared by the USGS Astrogeology Research Program for NASA. There are numerous data sets available, covering many planets and satellites, from numerous spaced exploration missions, such as Viking, Voyager, and Clementine.   In addition to the web site tools for exploring these images, the site offers the Map-a-Planet Web Map Service, an online service for accessing image data from desktop GIS and mapping software.",

  "description" : "The Chesapeake Information Management System (CIMS), designed in 1996, is an integrated, accessible information management system for the Chesapeake Bay Region.  CIMS is an organized, distributed library of information and software tools designed to increase basin-wide public access to Chesapeake Bay information.  The information delivered by CIMS includes technical and public information, educational material, environmental indicators, policy documents, and scientific data.  Through the use of relational databases, web-based programming, and web-based GIS a large number of Internet resources have been established.  These resources include multiple distributed on-line databases, on-demand graphing and mapping of environmental data, and geographic searching tools for environmental information.  Baseline monitoring data, summarized data and environmental indicators that document ecosystem status and trends, confirm linkages between water quality, habitat quality and abundance, and the distribution and integrity of biological populations are also available. One of the major features of the CIMS network is the Chesapeake Bay Program's Data Hub, providing users access to a suite of long- term water quality and living resources databases.  Chesapeake Bay mainstem and tidal tributary water quality, benthic macroinvertebrates, toxics, plankton, and fluorescence data can be obtained for a network of over 800 monitoring stations.",
