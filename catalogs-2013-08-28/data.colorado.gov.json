  "description" : "BlackBearHumanConflict is an ESRI SDE Feature Class showing human/bear conflict areas for Black Bear (Ursus americanus) in Colorado. Human/bear Conflict Areas are defined as that portion of the overall range where two or more confirmed black bear complaints per season were received which resulted in Colorado Division of Wildlife investigation, damage to persons or property (cabins, tents, vehicles, etc.), and/or the removal of the problem bear(s). This does not include damage caused by bears to livestock.This information was derived from field personnel. A variety of data capture techniques were used including drawing on mylar overlays at 1:50,000 scale USGS county mapsheets and implementation of the SmartBoard Interactive Whiteboard using stand-up, real-time digitizing at various scales (Cowardin, M., M. Flenner. March 2003. Maximizing Mapping Resources. GeoWorld 16(3):32-35).",

In block larger than 2 sq. mi. broadband service is shown on roads within that block. The data set also includes \"Community Anchor Institutions\" (CAIs) and their broadband service.

  "description" : "Publicly Accessible Open Space Inventory - Denver Metro Green Space Study. (Copyright 2011. The Trust for Public Land. All Rights Reserved) In 2011, The Trust for Public Land (TPL) partnered with Great Outdoors Colorado (GOCO) to examine conservation priorities for children's access to green spaces, protecting riparian habitats, and enhancing regional trail connectivity across the 8-county Denver Metropolitan region. The study area for this project includes all or portions of the following counties: Adams, Arapahoe, Jefferson, Denver, Douglas, Weld, Broomfield, and Boulder. Study area boundaries were defined to encompass the Denver Regional 2035 Urban Growth boundary, using the MPO boundary to the east and the mountain backdrop to the west. A fundamental milestone for this project was to create an up-to-date inventory of publicly accessible parks, green space, and trails. The dataset depicts publicly access parks and open space, with over 30 jurisdictions and organizations contributing data including: Counties: Adams Arapahoe Jefferson Denver Douglas Weld Broomfield Boulder Cities and Local Jurisdictions: Arvada Aurora Boulder Brighton Castle Rock Commerce City Golden Greenwood Village Highlands Ranch Ken Caryl Lakewood Littleton Longmont Louisville Parker Thornton Westminster Wheat Ridge Foot Hills Recreation District South Suburban Parks and Recreation Other Partners: Learning Landscapes DRCOG COMAP State of Colorado Colorado Open Lands",

It contains several layers reflecting the methods of reporting coverage required by the NTIA. The NTIA requires census block less than 2 sq. mi. to have information about the service available in the block, including service provider, speed and technology platform. In block larger than 2 sq. mi. broadband service is shown on roads within that block. The data set also includes \"Community Anchor Institutions\" (CAIs) and their broadband service. The data is compiled by asking broadband service providers about their service. In addition, the CAIs provide their service information to OIT directly.",

Given the state of the industry, Colorado’s IT infrastructure and footprint, and the opportunities that are available, Colorado is proceeding with a “cloud first” policy, mirroring the Federal government’s cloud policy.  To that end, Colorado is making a deliberate and explicit policy to “cloud first” services. The State will proceed with the presumption that new services, applications and major revisions to existing applications will be supported in a cloud based environment first, unless there are substantive reasons why they should be hosted on the State’s private infrastructure.",

  "description" : "The Colorado Information Marketplaces addresses the need to shift focus from siloed data exchanges, which can be prone to misinterpretation, inaccuracy, and risk. Instead, the Colorado Information Marketplace relies on existing data standards, such as the National Information Exchange Model and a governance model to create a reusable source of information for both state, local, county, city, tribal and other external entities that qualify for access and use of the data. The CIM framework applies both consistency of data standards and governance for privacy and security, while improving data transparency and reuse. Mission critical information empowers people to make better decisions in a real time (or near real time) environment, rather than waiting months or, in some cases, years to get access to the right data. Information exchanges will benefit every agency with the State, which will in turn benefit every citizen.",

The targeted industries represent almost 60 percent of the state’s jobs and an equivalent percentage of the state’s economic output. Our approach is simple: the most efficient and effective means of adding jobs is to drive growth in the industries which are already strong within the state.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to attachment to review the Colorado Blueprint.",
