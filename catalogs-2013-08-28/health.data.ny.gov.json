  "description" : "The Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (SWSCR) collects weight status category data (underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese, based on BMI-for-age percentile).  The dataset includes separate estimates of the percent of students overweight, obese and overweight or obese for all reportable grades within the county and/or region and by grade groups (elementary and middle/high).   The rates of overweight and obesity reported are percentages based on counts of students in selected grades (Pre-K, K, 2, 4, 7, 10) reported to the NYSDOH. Because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.

  "description" : "The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is a nutrition education and meal reimbursement program helping providers serve nutritious and safely prepared meals and snacks to children and adults in day care settings. This dataset includes the names and locations of participating day care sites and whether or not the site is Breastfeeding Friendly Certified with CACFP, participating in the Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings (EWPHCCS) project, or participating in the Eat Well Play Hard in Day Care Homes (EWPHDCH) project.   This dataset excludes Child and Adult Care Food Program participation provided at homeless shelters and legally-exempt day care home providers.  \r\n\r\nNot all counties in NYS are serviced by the grantees implementing the project EWPHCSS. \r\n\r\nThe EWPHDCH project is currently limited to the areas served by the contracted agencies. \r\n\r\nThe Child and Adult Care Food Program dataset is related to the Child Care Related Programs dataset on the www.Open.ny.gov website, however this dataset includes additional nutrition information.  The Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) is currently working to update the Child Care Related Programs dataset on a more frequent schedule with the OPEN NY team.  OCFS and DOH will then be able to synchronize in the near future.  Temporarily, DOH has omitted addresses for regulated child care providers that provide home care since this information is available on www.Open.ny.gov by using this link: https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Child-Care-Regulated-Programs/cb42-qumz.   \r\n\r\n For more information, please visit http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/nutrition/cacfp/ or go to the \"About\" tab.",

The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  This dataset includes tracking indicators for Prevent Chronic Diseases priority area and focus areas, but tracking indicators for the other priority areas will be added.  Along with the name of each indicator are given the baseline year, the baseline year county value of the indicator, and the Prevention Agenda 2017 state target for the indicator. Sub-indicators are included in this dataset to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups. .
